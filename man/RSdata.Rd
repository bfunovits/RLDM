\description{
This dataset contains a (248 x 7)-dimensional matrix with quarterly US data from the first quarter
of 1947 till the last quarter of 2008.
The script for transforming the raw data (as csv-file) to the matrix RSdata is available
in the \emph{data-raw} directory.
The data set is used to identify government spending shocks and in particular to
investigate the response of consumption and real wages with respect to these shocks.
All variables are orthogonalized with respect to an intercept and a linear trend.
See \url{https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjq008} for more details.
