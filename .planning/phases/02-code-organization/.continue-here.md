<current_state>
Phase 1 (Repository Foundation) completed successfully with 5 plans executed. All success criteria met:
- Root directory contains only essential files
- Benchmark scripts moved to inst/benchmarks
- Log files moved to logs/
- Comprehensive .gitignore established

Phase 2 (Code Organization) is next but not yet planned. No active tasks or plans in progress.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 1 complete: 5 plans executed (01-01 through 01-05)
- Repository foundation established: clean root, organized directories, proper gitignore
- All Phase 1 requirements satisfied: REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 2: Code Organization — needs planning and execution
- No specific tasks defined yet
- Phase depends on completion of Phase 1 (ready)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- CONTRIBUTING.md kept in root (R package convention overrides Plan 01-04 decision)
- *.code-workspace pattern added to .gitignore for IDE file exclusion
- Standard R package organization: _pkgdown.yml → inst/, RLDM.Rproj → keep in root
- Development tool directories (.claude/, .serena/) excluded via .gitignore
- Dual exclusion strategy: both .gitignore and .Rbuildignore exclude development directories
- LICENSE.md format (markdown) instead of LICENSE for better readability
- Benchmark scripts belong in inst/benchmarks/ (installed with package)
- Utility scripts in root (compile_pf.R, simple_test.R) kept as package utilities
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ready to start.

<context>
Just completed Phase 1 cleanup. The repository foundation is solid with proper structure. Ready to move to Phase 2 focusing on code organization: reviewing C++ code in src/, ensuring R file numeric prefix consistency, organizing S3 methods, and reviewing DESCRIPTION dependencies.

Phase 2 success criteria:
1. C++ code in src/ is reviewed and cleaned up
2. R files follow numeric prefix consistency (01_, 02_, etc.)
3. S3 methods are properly organized and registered
4. DESCRIPTION file dependencies are reviewed and updated

Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (complete). No technical blockers. The mental context is "between phases" — ready to plan the next phase.

<next_action>
Start Phase 2 planning: either `/gsd:discuss-phase 2` to gather context and clarify approach, or `/gsd:plan-phase 2` to plan directly.
