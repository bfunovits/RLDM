<current_state>
We are in Phase 2 (Code Organization) discussion using /gsd:discuss-phase. User selected two gray areas to discuss:
1. C++ code cleanup priorities
2. R file organization approach

We started discussing first area (C++ priorities). Asked first question: "What should be the primary focus of C++ code cleanup?" User answered: "Comment quality and completeness".

We asked second question: "What commenting style should we use for C++ code?" but user interrupted before answering.

Discussion paused mid-conversation.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 2 discussion initiated
- Gray areas identified and presented to user
- User selected two areas to discuss
- First question answered: C++ cleanup focus = comment quality and completeness
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Complete second question about C++ commenting style
- Continue discussion of C++ priorities (more questions if needed)
- Move to second selected area: R file organization approach
- Complete discussion of all selected areas
- Create CONTEXT.md with decisions
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- C++ code cleanup primary focus: Comment quality and completeness (over style consistency, dead code removal, performance optimization)
</decisions_made>

<context>
We are in the /gsd:discuss-phase workflow for Phase 2. The goal is to capture implementation decisions that downstream agents (researcher and planner) need. We need to continue the discussion loop: ask 4 questions per area, then check if user wants more questions or move to next area.

After completing discussion, we need to create CONTEXT.md in the phase directory with decisions captured.

Phase boundary from ROADMAP.md: "Well-organized, maintainable code structure" with success criteria:
1. C++ code in src/ is reviewed and cleaned up
2. R files follow numeric prefix consistency (01_, 02_, etc.)
3. S3 methods are properly organized and registered
4. DESCRIPTION file dependencies are reviewed and updated
</context>

<next_action>
Resume discussion by presenting the interrupted question: "What commenting style should we use for C++ code?" with options:
- Doxygen-style (/** */) with @param @return
- Simple // comments explaining intent
- Minimal comments, self-documenting code
- You decide — pick appropriate style

Then continue with remaining questions for C++ priorities area, then move to R file organization approach.
