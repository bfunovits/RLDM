  <what-built>Fixed pkgdown configuration and committed changes for website deployment</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. **Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions:**
   - If changes haven't been pushed yet: `git push origin main`
   - Wait for GitHub Actions to complete (check Actions tab in GitHub repository)

2. **Verify website deployment:**
   - Visit https://bfunovits.github.io/RLDM/
   - Check that website loads without errors
   - Navigate to Reference section
   - Verify "RcppArmadillo Implementations - Solving" section is NOT present (was removed in Plan 05-01)
   - Check that other documentation sections are present and correct

3. **Verify Phase 4 documentation improvements:**
   - Check package documentation (?RLDM) appears on website
   - Verify examples are present for functions (from Phase 4 work)
   - Check that mathematical notation renders correctly (MathJax)

4. **Check GitHub Actions status:**
   - Visit GitHub repository -> Actions tab
   - Verify latest pkgdown workflow completed successfully
   - Check for any errors in build log

3. Update plans list:
   - Change `**Plans:** TBD` → `**Plans:** 3 plans`
   - Replace placeholder plan list with actual plans:
     ```
     Plans:
     - [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Configuration verification and fixes
     - [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Build test and commit
     - [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Verification and roadmap update
     ```

4. Update progress table:
   - Change "Website Deployment" status from "Not started" to "Complete"
   - Add completion date: "2026-01-30"

5. Save updated ROADMAP.md
  </action>
