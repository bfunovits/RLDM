<current_state>
Executing Phase 3 (Build Verification) gap closure plans with `--gaps-only` flag. Identified 3 gap closure plans: 03-03 (documentation fixes), 03-04 (test failures), 03-05 (final verification). Plans grouped by wave: wave 3 (03-03), wave 4 (03-04), wave 5 (03-05). Wave-based parallel execution: each wave runs sequentially, autonomous plans within same wave run in parallel.

About to spawn gsd-executor agent for plan 03-03 (wave 3). Generated prompt with inlined plan content, state content, and config content. User paused before agent spawned.

BUILD-01 criteria: 0 errors, ≤1 warning in final check. Current gaps per STATE.md: documentation warnings (Rd cross-reference issues), stochastic test failures (pfilter test RMSE < 0.5 expectation too strict), vignette system dependency (pandoc-citeproc missing, treated as external).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Task 1: Execute wave 3 (plan 03-03) - Not started (agent about to be spawned)
  </completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 1: Execute wave 3 (plan 03-03) - Spawn gsd-executor agent, wait for completion, verify success
- Task 2: Execute wave 4 (plan 03-04) - Spawn gsd-executor agent for test failure fixes
- Task 3: Execute wave 5 (plan 03-05) - Spawn gsd-executor agent for final verification
- Task 4: Verify phase goal after gap closures - Run gsd-verifier to confirm BUILD-01 achieved
- Task 5: Update roadmap and state - Mark Phase 3 complete in ROADMAP.md, update STATE.md
- Task 6: Commit phase completion - Create final commit with all changes
  </remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Identified gap closure plans based on frontmatter `gap_closure: true` (03-03, 03-04, 03-05)
- Grouped plans by wave (3, 4, 5) for sequential execution (waves run sequentially, autonomous plans within wave run in parallel)
- Model profile balanced → gsd-executor: sonnet, gsd-verifier: sonnet (from config.json)
- BUILD-01 success criteria: 0 errors, ≤1 warning in devtools::check()
- Vignette system dependency (pandoc-citeproc) treated as external, not code issue

<context>
We are executing gap closure plans to address remaining issues preventing BUILD-01 achievement. Documentation warnings (Rd cross-references, usage sections) need fixing in 03-03. Stochastic test failures (pfilter test) need adjustment of RMSE threshold or seed reproducibility in 03-04. Final verification in 03-05 will handle vignette system dependency and confirm BUILD-01 criteria met.

Wave execution workflow: each wave spawns gsd-executor agents for autonomous plans. After all waves, verify phase goal with gsd-verifier, then update roadmap and commit.

Plan 03-03 tasks: Fix kf_cpp references in examples, fix ll_kf_cpp cross-references, fix ll_pf cross-references, fix solve_rmfd_cpp cross-references, fix LaTeX errors, run devtools::document(), fix Rd usage section warnings, verify fixes.
