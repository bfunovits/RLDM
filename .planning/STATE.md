## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap Creation]: Created 5-phase structure focusing on repository cleanup, code organization, build verification, documentation, and website deployment
- [Roadmap Creation]: Mapped all 15 v1 requirements to phases with 100% coverage
- [01-01 Execution]: Use .gitkeep files to track empty directories in git (standard practice for R package development)
- [01-01 Execution]: Organize .gitignore with commented sections for maintainability (R package artifacts, C++ build, documentation, IDE/OS files)
- [01-01 Execution]: Dual exclusion strategy - both .gitignore and .Rbuildignore exclude development directories (logs/, figure/, data-raw/)
- [01-01 Execution]: LICENSE.md format (markdown) instead of LICENSE (plain text) for better readability and GitHub rendering
